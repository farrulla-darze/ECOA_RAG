We have a broken redirection to the t&c's for the level up campaign but only on the onboarding page and we are almost at the end of the release train. Our first opportunity to fix this would be in next release in 2 week. It's only for iOS. Would we get in trouble with the compliance authorities if the fix will be in next possible release?,"Yes, in case the Regulator becomes aware of this failure we may face some administrative constraint or sanctioning, notably in case we have systematic complaints from players.

"Question remains regarding the possibility of using the “chave móvel” option, in fact, entities like Jogos Santa Casa use this option, at registration at least, (process attached).Could this be an option to replace the identity card collection when reaching 2k€ (art 25º/2 a) and 4ii) Law 83/2017) ? If so, do you know the data list accessible through this method?For my part, I think this is too restrictive an option, as most of our customers probably won't have this “cháve móvel”, but we'd like to hear your opinion and find out if it's feasible.","The “chave móvel” has been considered in different instances, about 4 years ago XXX team was leading this initiative, and PERSON, if I am not mistaken, was also involved in this feature.From a gaming compliance standpoint, having it would be excellent, since it creates a very safe means of identification and KYC. I believe it could be a good solution for the 2k€. It entails the Civil ID, phone number and biometric data (https://www.autenticacao.gov.pt/web/guest/chave-movel-digital/autenticacao). I believe it is feasible and can be used in addition the registration process: if I am not wrong Poland already have a similar solution, activated after registration.Let me know if you need any additional support on my side.","Base de Dados para Puc-Rio\SRIJ Regulação e Normas\___DL n.º 66_2015, de 29 de Abril.pdf; Base de Dados para Puc-Rio\SRIJ Regulação e Normas\Regulamento Requisitos Sistema Tecnico de Jogo ONLINE.pdf"
We do not apply fees. Would it be possible to apply fees ? Under what conditions ?,"Although the regulation does not expressly authorize operators to charge fees, there are several provisions that refer to them. Nevertheless, SRIJ latest understanding on this subject was that we could not charge fees, and it is unlikely we can change their position. In any case, we could try to request SRIJ authorization to charge fees on specific situations related to payments, by requesting a new T&C rule. What specific kind of fees would you like to consider?","Base de Dados para Puc-Rio\SRIJ Regulação e Normas\___DL n.º 66_2015, de 29 de Abril.pdf; Base de Dados para Puc-Rio\SRIJ Regulação e Normas\Regulamento Requisitos Sistema Tecnico de Jogo ONLINE.pdf; Base de Dados para Puc-Rio\SRIJ Regulação e Normas\ESTUDOS INDEPENDENTES\Liberdade em Mercado Regulado\Possible arguments on the issue.docx"
